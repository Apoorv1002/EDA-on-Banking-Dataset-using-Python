# EDA-on-Banking-Dataset-using-Python

Introduction to EDA : 
Exploratory Data Analysis is an integral part of any Data Analytics and Data Analytics activity. It helps Data Analysts understand their dataset - its features, their types, their average values, their ranges, any possible correlations between features etc., identify any outliers that the dataset may have, shape and size of the dataset and many other pieces of valuable information. In essence, Exploratory Data Analysis is the act of critically examining the dataset in order to get to know it.

Language Used : 
Python is a very powerful high level programming language. It provides several free open source libraries that extend its capabilities - 'pandas' is one such library. 'pandas' is the standard choice for exploring, analyzing and manipulating data. In this project, I have tried to familiarize myself with the building blocks of 'pandas' library - pandas data frames and pandas series. I have also applied various pandas methods and data frame attributes known to me to conduct a preliminary investigation 
on this banking dataset. This investigation has helped me generate some valuable insights into the dataset - leaving me with my first taste of practical Data Science.

Insights Generated :
What is the share of clients attracted in our source data? (Helps calculate the efficacy of current business model, and if changes are needed to be made)
What are the mean values of numerical features among the attracted clients? (Gives a fair description as to who exactly the business model is able to attract)
What is the average call duration for the attracted clients? (Can be an important driver in Sales Teams' Training - how long should call duration be to boost chances of successful call)
Who is most attracted - bachelors, married or divorced? (Helps conduct targetted marketing campaigns)
Average age of clients who buy insurance and number of calls required to attract them? (Reveals which age group bank is able to make most succesful conversions and where more work is needed)
Most frequent age bracket of dataset?
Upper ceiling for call duration, most frequent call duration, and the relationship between call duration and age.
Distribution of various numerical features of the data frame.
Job category of attracted clients and their educational qualifications.

Dataset Source:
The data that we are going to use for this project is a subset of an open source Bank Marketing Data Set from the UCI ML repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/citation_policy.html.
This dataset is publicly available for research. The details are described in [Moro et al., 2014].
